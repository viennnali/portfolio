## Hi, Vienna here!

I’m a graphic designer and web designer, recently graduating from UC Davis where I majored in design and minored in psychology. I’m a lover of typography, grid, and website layouts.

I’ve lived in many places—New York, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Los Angeles, and Seoul, where I had the luckily had chance to connect and interact with people of different cultures.

In my free time, I love playing instruments, reading novels, and drawing my favorite fictional characters.
