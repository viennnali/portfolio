I"Ó<p>This was an branding project from my graphic design class, which was to create a brand surrounding an edible insect â€” I was assigned the Ruspolia nitidula, more commonly known as bush crickets. I called my imaginary brand Criquette Bakery and decided to make it specialize in macarons.</p>

<p>The logo shape is based on the body and wings of crickets. Despite all those embellishments from my initial sketches, I decided to remove them and go with the most simple silhouette, paired with Gilroy, a simple and bold font, as the full logo.</p>

<p>The moss and mint colors here mirror the natural colors of bush crickets, while the pastel colors (periwinkle, turquoise, rose, and yolk) are the colors of the macarons.</p>
