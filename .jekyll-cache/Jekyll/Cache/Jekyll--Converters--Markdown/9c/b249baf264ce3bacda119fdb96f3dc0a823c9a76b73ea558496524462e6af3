I"P<p>This was an branding project from my graphic design class, which was to create a brand surrounding an edible insect — I was assigned the Ruspolia nitidula, more commonly known as bush crickets. I called my imaginary brand Criquette Bakery and decided to make it specialize in macarons.</p>

<p>The logo shape is based on the body and wings of crickets. Despite all those embellishments from my initial sketches, I decided to remove them and go with the most simple silhouette.</p>

<h2 id="project-strategy">Project Strategy</h2>
<p>The outer package has a half-cylinder lid with a radius of 1 inch, and attaches to the bottom rectangular prism, which has dimensions of 1 inch x 2 inch x 7 inch. The overall packaging resembles the shape of a treasure chest. There is a small window on the top, which allows the consumer to preview the contents inside. This semi-transparent window has veins that mimic the pattern of bush cricket shells, which has been evolved to enable bush crickets to camouflage itself on tree leaves. There are also individual wrappers around macarons inside to help retain shape, and have tabs to allow the consumer to easily pull macarons out. These wrappers are made of compostable material that breaks down quickly after disposal.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Most of the famous macaron brands focus their identities on high-class and heritage, and many currently have their own bakeries and online shops. However, they are seldomly distributed in other places, such as grocery and convenience stores. Also, many of these brands use boxes outside and plastic inside the boxes to protect the shape of macarons during distribution. These brands use an excessive amount of material for packaging, in the name of “luxury” and “extravagance.” Not only does this type of packaging generate too much waste, but also takes up a considerable amount of extra space, making it more costly to deliver.</p>

<h2 id="message">Message</h2>
<p>Criquette Bakery’s macarons are healthy and full of protein, and made with a limited list of natural ingredients. Its refined and elegant packaging, but affordability and wide accessibility, makes it a wonderful item for gifting during holidays or special events for busy women.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="audience">Audience</h2>
<p>Criquette Bakery’s macarons have a target audience of young women ages 18-25, and their income ranges from $20,000 to $50,000 a year. This includes women who are just entering university or have just graduated and started working, and are generally busy with school and work. They are attracted to decadent packaging and luxury items, but wish it could be more affordable and accessible to purchase. Therefore, Criquette Bakery macarons will be priced at a lower point than at high-end bakeries, and distributed at neighborhood markets and convenience stores.</p>
