## Hi, Vienna here!

I’m a lover of typography, grid, and website layouts. At UC Davis, I studied design and psychology.

I’ve lived in New York, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Los Angeles, and Seoul. I am so grateful to have had the chance to connect and interact with people of different cultural backgrounds.

In my free time, I love playing instruments, reading novels, and drawing my favorite fictional characters.
