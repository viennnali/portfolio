This was an branding project from my graphic design class, which was to create a brand surrounding an edible insect — I was assigned the Ruspolia nitidula, more commonly known as bush crickets. I called my imaginary brand Criquette Bakery and decided to make it specialize in macarons.

The logo shape is based on the body and wings of crickets. Despite all those embellishments from my initial sketches, I decided to remove them and go with the most simple silhouette, paired with Gilroy, a simple and bold font, as the full logo.

The moss and mint colors here mirror the natural colors of bush crickets, while the pastel colors (periwinkle, turquoise, rose, and yolk) are the colors of the macarons.

## Background

Most of the famous macaron brands focus their identities on high-class and heritage, and many currently have their bakeries and online shops. However, they are seldomly distributed in other places, such as grocery and convenience stores. Also, many of these brands use boxes outside and plastic inside the boxes to protect the shape of macarons during distribution. These brands use an excessive amount of material for packaging, in the name of “luxury” and “extravagance.” This type of packaging generates too much waste and takes up a considerable amount of extra space, making it more costly to deliver.

## Message
Criquette Bakery’s macarons are healthy and full of protein and made with a limited list of natural ingredients. Its refined and elegant packaging, but affordability and wide accessibility, make it a wonderful gift item for busy women during holidays or special events.
