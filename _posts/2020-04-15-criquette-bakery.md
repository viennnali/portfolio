This was an branding project from my graphic design class, which was to create a brand surrounding an edible insect â€” I was assigned the Ruspolia nitidula, more commonly known as bush crickets. I called my imaginary brand Criquette Bakery and decided to make it specialize in macarons.

The logo shape is based on the body and wings of crickets. Despite all those embellishments from my initial sketches, I decided to remove them and go with the most simple silhouette, paired with Gilroy, a simple and bold font, as the full logo.

The moss and mint colors here mirror the natural colors of bush crickets, while the pastel colors (periwinkle, turquoise, rose, and yolk) are the colors of the macarons.
